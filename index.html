       <p><em>An action-packed book, remains a favorite even after years. I first saw this book from a classmate in 2015,
        and I couldn't look away... Such a mysterious, frightening, and at the same time, attractive atmosphere flew around the work.
        I asked to read it for only a week, and it took me all day to realize that I want it on my shelf!
        But what exactly made her so attractive?
        I will tell you about this in this short article.</em></p>

        <p><em>This is a very fascinating book, while I was in college, all four parts became something everyday. I couldn't imagine a day without reading it
          already a favorite book. As the years passed, I often lent my friends parts of my favorite book.
          Walking through a bookstore in December, I noticed a familiar name on the cover: "Madeline Ru".
          During this time, she released a new besseler: "House of Shadows" and "Court of Shadows" - the second part.
          There is also a third... but I wasn't destined to buy it and read it.</em></p>
